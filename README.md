# Ultra WideBand
**Ultra WideBand (UWB)** is a short range wireless communication technology that can track location accurately and secure data transmissions. It operates on [BLE or Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy).

[IEEE_802.15.4z](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.15.4z/10230/) is an amendment to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is focused on enhancing **Ultra WideBand (UWB) Physical Layers (PHYs).** Approved in **May 15, 2020**. It introduces advanced ranging techniques such as [time-of-light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_flight) for precise measurement.
